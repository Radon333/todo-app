# Contributing to this repository
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

Before you begin:
- Have you checked the what version of various sofwares have we used?
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Make changes according to your requirements
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update in the forked repo.
  - Are you making changes to the application code? You'll need to check the dependancies.
  - Are you contributing to markdown? We use [GitHub Markdown](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! The whole GitHub community thanks you. :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the [contributor chart](https://github.com/github/docs/graphs/contributors).




## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
